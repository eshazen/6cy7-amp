## Want to build one?

Contact Matt at musicalpowersupplies.com and ask for:
4
```
(1) PT190.2 USA   (or international version if not in USA)
(2) OT8SE
```
Then, order everything on the BOM:  https://github.com/eshazen/6cy7-amp/blob/main/amp/amp.ods

Note:  You need both tubes and sockets

Tubes: 2x 6CY7 and 1x EZ81/6CA4.  Best order a spare of each.

Sockets are on the BOM from AES (Antique Electronic Supply @ tubesandmore.com)

Other parts are mostly from Digikey
