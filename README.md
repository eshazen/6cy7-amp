# 6c67-amp

This is a low power single-ended tridode (SET) hi-fi amp for the
bedroom.  It is essentially a build of the Cascade Tubes "Zebrawood"
amp: https://www.cascadetubes.com/the-6cy7-v2-0-zebrawood-amp/.  I'm
using transformers from MusicalPowerSupplies.com.

PCB design here is 388 x 194mm.  It will be the standard 1oz copper, 1.6mm thick.
Everything is on the PCB.  Plan is to just set it on feet / standoffs.
We'll see how it goes... this is an experiment!

* 2/29/20: Iron ordered from MusicalPowerSupplies.com for a ~ 1/15/21 ship date
* 1/2/21: Parts ordered from DigiKey and Antique Electronic Supply
* 1/3/21: PCBs ordered from JLC (white soldermask, black silkscreen, cool, eh?)

Total spent with some spare stuff thrown in ~ US $350.00.  Hope to have it running by end of January!

**Speakers** Need some small bookshelf speakers to go with it.  Will test the amp with what I have lying around before making any decisions.  The easiest would be to buy another pair of Minimus-7's and apply the 'Zilch' crossover mod.
