# 6c67-amp

This is a low power single-ended tridode (SET) hi-fi amp for the
bedroom.  It is essentially a build of the Cascade Tubes "Zebrawood"
amp: https://www.cascadetubes.com/the-6cy7-v2-0-zebrawood-amp/.  I'm
using transformers from MusicalPowerSupplies.com.

PCB design here is 388 x 194mm.  It will be the standard 1oz copper, 1.6mm thick.
Everything is on the PCB.  Plan is to just set it on feet / standoffs.
We'll see how it goes... this is an experiment!
