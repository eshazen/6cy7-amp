# 6c67-amp

This is a low power single-ended tridode (SET) hi-fi amp for the
bedroom.  It is essentially a build of the Cascade Tubes "Zebrawood"
amp: https://www.cascadetubes.com/the-6cy7-v2-0-zebrawood-amp/.  I'm
using transformers from MusicalPowerSupplies.com.

Current plan is to put everything on one red PCB just for fun.  Hoping
to fit in about 200x300mm or so.  Lots of standoffs to suppor the
iron.  Maybe a plexiglas case eventually.
